🏥 NLP for Medical Use Case - Pathology Report Classification
📌 Problem Statement
Pathology reports primarily consist of unstructured free-text narratives written by pathologists.
Extracting meaningful clinical information from such reports is challenging, as they are not directly queryable.

Multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been proposed to automate the classification of pathology reports into relevant categories (such as diagnosis codes, cancer type, stage, etc.).

Automating this process can help:

✅ Improve structured data availability in healthcare systems
✅ Support clinical research and registries
✅ Enable large-scale population studies
✅ Enhance clinical decision support

🎯 Project Goal
👉 Apply NLP techniques to classify free-text pathology reports into meaningful labels.
👉 Build a baseline text classification pipeline for medical text.
👉 Evaluate model performance on the task.
👉 Provide an end-to-end example notebook for future reuse.

📚 Dataset
For demonstration purposes, this notebook uses a public dataset suitable for text classification.

Example: Simulated pathology reports or a medical text dataset.

In real clinical settings, this would be run on internal hospital datasets.
